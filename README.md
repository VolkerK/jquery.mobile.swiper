Simple swiper for jQuery Mobile
===============================
What is it
----------
A lightweight jQuery Mobile Plug-in that loads a new page when you swipe right or left.
How to use
----------
Put *jquery.mobile.swiper.js* into your jQuery Mobile application like you would do with any other plugin.<br>
You can then add data-swipeleft and data-swipright attributes to you're data-role="page".

```html
<div data-role="page" data-swipeleft="page1.html" data-swiperight="page2.html">
    Swipe left to page1
    Swipe right to page2
</div>
```
This plugin is applied, when data-role="page" has an data-swipeleft **or** data-swipright attribute.<br>
Take a look at the examples, it is really easy.
